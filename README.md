# Boa Web Debugger

This is a proof of concept work on a web based debugger.

Overall, this is pretty barebones right now, but some basically functionality exists if I can get it up
and hosted on Github pages.

## Please Note:

This is arguably highly experimental.

This functionality is not currently merged with the main Boa branch, and is a specifically locally compiled
version that creates some wasm hooks into Boa's tracing functionality.

There is no guarantee that the wasm-packed version of Boa is up to date with main.
